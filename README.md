Modular  feedforward neural network via multitask learning


        
Note that we only increase hidden neurons for different tasks given by respective modular topologies. This is essentially a SGD implementation of evolutionary multi-task learning for modular network design given in this paper. http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-46672-9_5 (free copy: http://www.cil.ntu.edu.sg/mfo/downloads/cvmultask.pdf )
